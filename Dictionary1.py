#NOTE: 
'''    Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values,
       used to store data values like a map, which unlike other Data Types, 
       that hold only single value as an element, Dictionary holds key:value pair.
       Key value is provided in the dictionary to make it more optimized. 
 '''

#NOTE : 
'''Creating a Dictionary, In Python, a Dictionary can be created by placing sequence of elements within curly {} braces,
   separated by ‘comma’. Dictionary holds a pair of values, one being the Key and the other corresponding
   pair element being its Key:value. Values in a dictionary can be of any datatype and can be duplicated, 
   whereas keys can’t be repeated and must be immutable.
