#  Python Loops
# NOTE:
# To decide or control the flow of a program, we have branching and looping techniques in Python.
# To perform decision-making, we use the if-else statement in Python. To iterate over a sequence 
# of elements, we use for loop, and when we want to iterate a block of code repeatedly,as long as
# the condition is true, we use the while loop.

# NOTE:
#  Sometimes we want to reapeat a set of statement(s) in our program for instance, " PRINT  1 TO 1000 "
#  Loops make it easy for the prorammer to tell the computer, Which set of instruction(s) to repeat and how ?
# ********************************************************************************************************************************************


# NOTE > While loop
'''     while (condition):
            body of the loop

# Write a program to print 1 to 100 using while loop.
