# IAABank

IAABank is a bank-based python project to understand and practices of basics of python such as- Data Types, Conditions, Loops, Nesting, Mathematical Operations, and validation.

# How it works?

- When the program runs, it will ask for input as User Account_Number and the Users password.
- Maximum two times you can make mistakes, but at the last third time, the program will terminate. 
- After authentication, it gives you three options: Users_Details, Transaction, and Exit.
- In the Users_Details option, it gives Users_ID, Users_Name, and Users_Balance.
- In the Transactions option, gives three options: Debit, Credit, and Transfer Money with remaining balance information.
- In Exit option is to terminate the program with a message
- In the Transaction option we can debit, credit, and transfer money in another account are using account_number and show the remaining balance.

# What Next
- To use this project in another project to make it more dynamic for example shopping from site and debit from this bank account and above.
Dynamic approach of the work in other projects are still on the processing line
