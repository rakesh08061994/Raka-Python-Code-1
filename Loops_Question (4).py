# Python program to illustrate
# Iterating over a list

# list1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]        # List is like a bullet box
# for Item in list1:             # Item is triger and for loop is like a gun
#     print(Item)                # loop statement is like fire rounds



# NOTE >
#  If we provide a list, tuple, and string to for loop in advance, Then we will not use range() function.
#  Because we have already elements in the form of list,tuple,string

for Item in range(1,21):
    print(Item)
